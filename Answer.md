1.Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.


The relationship between the “Product” and “Product_Category” entities from the provided database schema diagram is

1.The “Product” entity represents individual products in the system. It contains the following attributes:
id: An integer representing the unique identifier for each product.
name: A string (varchar) indicating the name of the product.
desc: A text field describing the product.
SKU: A string representing the Stock Keeping Unit for inventory management.
category_id: An integer that serves as a foreign key referencing the corresponding category in the “Product_Category” entity.
inventory_id: An integer linking to the inventory details for this product.
price: A decimal value representing the product’s price.
discount_id: An integer referencing the applicable discount (if any).
created_at, modified_at, and deleted_at: Timestamps for record management.


2.Product_Category Entity:

The “Product_Category” entity represents different categories or types of products. It includes the following attributes:
id: An integer uniquely identifying each category.
name: A string (varchar) specifying the name of the category.
desc: A text field providing additional details about the category.
created_at, modified_at, and deleted_at: Timestamps for record management.


3.Relationship:
The relationship between the “Product” and “Product_Category” entities is established through the category_id attribute in the “Product” entity.
Each product is associated with a specific category by referencing the corresponding category’s unique ID.
This relationship allows efficient categorization and organization of products within the system.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

We can use Foreign Key Constraint:
Add a foreign key column in the “Product” table that references the category ID from the “Product_Category” table.
This foreign key relationship ensures that each product must have a valid category ID associated with it.
For example, you can create a column named “category_id” in the “Product” table, which references the “id” column in the “Product_Category” table1.
